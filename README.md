玩寶可夢真的那麼危險？

資料介紹與來源
--------------

●A2\_record是事故類別：A2類的交通資料紀錄，A2的意思是交通事故當事人一人以上受傷(不管事輕傷或重傷)或超過24小時後死亡。 ●pokemon2 pokemontype 是全台各縣市寶可夢巢穴名稱及地點和CP值。 ●內政部警政署 (車禍事故資料) ●<http://kikinote.net/article/115309.html> (寶可夢資料) ●[http://www.otaku-hk.com/news/Pokemon-Go-%E5%B0%8F%E7%B2%BE%E9%9D%88%E6%95%B8%E6%93%9A%E8%AA%BF%E6%95%B4%E7%B8%BD%E8%A1%A8(CP,-%E6%94%BB%E5%8F%8A%E9%98%B2%E8%AE%8A%E5%8C%96)/412-1(寶可夢資料)](http://www.otaku-hk.com/news/Pokemon-Go-%E5%B0%8F%E7%B2%BE%E9%9D%88%E6%95%B8%E6%93%9A%E8%AA%BF%E6%95%B4%E7%B8%BD%E8%A1%A8(CP,-%E6%94%BB%E5%8F%8A%E9%98%B2%E8%AE%8A%E5%8C%96)/412-1(寶可夢資料))

分析議題
--------

●寶可夢GO是一款基於位置服務的擴增實境類手機遊戲，由任天堂公司、精靈寶可夢公司授權，Niantic, Inc.負責開發和營運。於2016年7月起在iOS和Android平台上發布。該遊戲允許玩家以現實世界為平台，捕捉、戰鬥、訓練和交易虛擬怪獸「寶可夢」。 ●台灣去年也盛行一時，因而產生一些問題，像是有些虛擬怪物會出現在特別的地方(例如：海邊、山區等等偏僻處)，使玩家會讓自己深入危險處，也有一些玩家會一邊開(騎)車一邊抓寶，以上問題皆可能造成自身安全受害。

假設
----

●自始Pokemon Go盛行，政府一再呼籲民眾玩樂之餘也要注意交通安全，卻仍在新聞媒體層出不窮出現因為玩寶可夢而致使交通打結的景況，欲藉由此期末專題了解交通是否因為寶可夢的盛行而有所影響，受傷人數多的區域是否皆為相同的寶可夢。 ●寶可夢是從105/08/06開始開放台灣下載的，因此假設是從該日期開始事故率逐漸提升。
